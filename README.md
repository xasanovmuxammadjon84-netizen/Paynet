# Simple To‑Do List (localStorage)

This is a small, beginner-friendly To‑Do list web app that stores tasks in the browser's `localStorage`. No server is needed.

Features:
- Add tasks
- Mark tasks complete / incomplete
- Edit tasks (double-click or edit button)
- Delete tasks
- Filter: All / Active / Completed
- Clear all completed tasks
- Tasks persist in browser localStorage

How to run:
1. Download the files (index.html, styles.css, app.js).
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or drag to browser).
3. Start adding tasks.

Notes:
- Data is stored on your device in localStorage under the key `todo_tasks_v1`.
- This is a simple demo — not for multi-user or production use.
- TODOs are left in `app.js` for future improvements.

If you want a React version, a server-backed version, or export/import functionality, tell me which and I can extend it.
